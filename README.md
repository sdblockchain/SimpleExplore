# Simpleexplore
A blockchain explorer system made by rdpstudio.


## What is a blockchain?

>A block chain is a transaction(Data) database shared by all nodes participating in a system based on the SimpleData protocol. A full copy of a currency(data)'s block chain contains every transaction(data) ever executed in the currency(data). With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any point in history. 


## How to run it

First, install ```requirements.txt```.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Than run main.py.

```
python main.py
```

## Contribution

Anybody is welcome to collaborate in this project. Feel free to push any pull request (even if you are new to coding). See ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` to learn how to contribute.

Note: the idea of this project is to build a **really simple** blockchain system, so make sure all your code is easy to read (avoid too much code in 1 line) and don't introduce complex updates if they are not critical. In other words, keep it simple.
